<h1> <p align="center"> Virtual Private Network Connections</h1>
<p align="center"> This tutorial outlines the implementation and connection to Virtual Private Networks and it's affect on IP addresses and location.<br />
<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
<p>
<p>
<p>
<br> 
<h2>Let's briefly describe how Virtual Private Networks work</h2> A VPN is a tool that allows you to access the internet securely wherever you are. It works by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and your VPN provider, and it protects you in two key ways. 
<p>  
<p>  1. Concealing your IP address, protecting your identity and location 
<p>  2. Encrypting your traffic between you and your VPN provider so that no one on your local network can decipher or modify it.
<p> Businesses also use remote access VPNs to establish a secure connection between their network and the devices used by remote workers. Once connected, employees are able to access the resources on the network just as if their devices were physically plugged in at the office.
<br>  
<br>
For the demonstration below I will create a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and assign it a region in another country. Then I will demonstrate how a VPN can be used to change it's IP Address and location to view another regions local content as if it were physically located there. We'll switch locations once more and observe the changes. The diagram below will illustrate this.

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<br>
<h2>Step 1.</h2>

**Create a Virtual Machine in Azure**
<p>
Let's begin with creating our Virtual Machine in Azure. We'll select a region for it outside of where we're currently located, in this case I've chosen Japan. Once the VM is created, take note of the Public IP Address and Location on the VM overview page.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 2.</h2>

**Log in and Check your IP Address**
<p>
Log into the VM via Remote Desktop. Once Window's is done booting, open the web browser and go to this website www.whatismyipaddress.com. This will show you the actual IP Address and region of the VM. Next try going to www.google.com and notice the native language of the region is displayed, in this case Japanese.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 3.</h2>

**Download and Install a VPN Client**
<p>
Select a VPN client that you would like to download and install, there are many options to choose from. For this example I will be using Proton VPN, which has a free version available here https://protonvpn.com. Once downloaded open the app, create an account and sign in.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 4.</h2>

**Select a VPN Connection**
<p>
Once signed in, you will be brought to a screen showing your current IP Address and status. This is where you can choose where you would like to establish the VPN server. For this example I will choose the Netherlands. Select the country and click connect. Once the connection is established, observe the changes on the VPN status screen.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 5.</h2>

**Verify VPN is Working**
<p>
Now that we've established a VPN connection, let's go back to the web browser and check our IP Address once more. Notice now that it is now showing the new location we connected to. We are now browsing from this new location as if we were physically located there. Try www.google.com again and you will now see it is displayed in Dutch, the native language of the Netherlands.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 6.</h2>

**Switch VPN Servers**
<p>
Let's try switching VPN servers to demonstrate changing locations once more. Go back to the VPN client and dissconnect it. Choose another region, in this case the U.S. and click connect.

<p>
<br>
<h2>Step 7.</h2>

**Check Web IP again**
<p>
Once again go back to the web and check both websites to verify the change.

<p>
<br>
You can switch servers again if you like and try to view another regions local content that is not available where you're located, for example a movie streaming service. You can also purchase the full version of Proton VPN and gain many more optoins as well as locations all over the world to connect from.
