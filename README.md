<h2>Let's briefly describe how do Virtual Private Networks work</h2> A VPN is a tool that allows you to access the internet securely wherever you are. It works by creating a secure “tunnel” between your device and your VPN provider, and it protects you in two key ways. 
<p>  
<p>  1. Concealing your IP address, protecting your identity and location 
<p>  2. Encrypting your traffic between you and your VPN provider so that no one on your local network can decipher or modify it.
